# Arithmetic_expression_reader
I was asked to do a Arithmetic Expression reader using Stack the requierements were.
Read only the symbols include in a arithmetic expression.
The user must be able to work with * - / and +,
The user wont be able to work with negatives numbers
The user must be told when he uses a bad input, for example Letters, Dots, Other symbols, And when he doesnt write correctly the expression, meaning, lack of operands, lack of numbers, etc.
